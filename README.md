# My Linux Autokey Remappings

These are key mappings using [autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) for Linux, because I recently migrated from macOS to Ubuntu

The goal is to use Mac-like keyboard shortcuts that my muscle memory is used to on laptops with a Windows keyboard layout.
Most of this is mapping things like `Alt+C` to `Ctrl+C` and so on (I use alt because on Windows layouts it is in the same place as command is on mac keyboards).

This also adds the awesome keyboard shortcuts for navigating around text on macOS (e.g. `cmd + left`, or `alt + left`) and so on.
